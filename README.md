# JD

This repo contains scripts I use related to my (not fully to the book) implementation of the [Jonny Decimal organsiation approach](https://johnnydecimal.com).

Since [Logseq](https://logseq.com) contains my [JD index](https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/) the scripts may not be useful if you use a different note taking system to hold your index.
